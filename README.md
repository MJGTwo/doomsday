# Doomsday Algorithm Practice
The purpose of this program is to practice the mental arithmetic of the
Doomsday rule/algorithm.

## History

The [Doomsday rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule) was devised
by John Conway in 1973. It works due to the Gregorian calendar moving in cycles
of 400 years.
Conway is also famous for his "Conway's Game of Life."

## How to run

Verify you have all the packages installed, then run Python3 with
`python main.py`. This will return a random date between 1980-01-01 and
2030-12-31. If you wish to know the day of the week of a given date, run
`python main.py --reveal=YYYY-MM-DD` which will return a day of the week.
